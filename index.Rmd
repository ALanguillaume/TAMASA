# Introduction

This document presents the whole data cleaning workflow use for Iemand et al. 2019

APS survey components:

* Household questionnaire – containing questions on household demography, agricultural landholdings, farm management, non-farm income sources, and other factors.

* *Focal* plot questionnaire – containing detailed agronomic management questions for the maize focal plot.

* Community questionnaire – containing questions about prices and market access conditions.


From TZAPS17_metadate.xlsx:

Household and focal plot files can be merged on hhid (i.e. to merge TZAPS17_hh.dta and TZAPS17_fp.dta).

Community data can be merged with household and focal plot data on site.
